 Noodles are typically very quick and easy to make. Having all your ingredients prepped, ready, and within hands reach before you begin will make the entire cooking process go smoothly. This is especially important for stir-fried noodles as you have to add different ingredients in quickly, one after the other, while continuously stir-frying.
