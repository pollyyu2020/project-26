Prep the ingredients before you start. Noodles are typically very quick and easy to make. Having all your ingredients prepped, ready, and within hands reach before you begin will make the entire cooking process go smoothly. This is especially important for stir-fried noodles as you have to add different ingredients in quickly, one after the other, while continuously stir-frying.

How to customize. Almost all these noodle recipes are completely customizable. You can add in or substitute any vegetables that you have on hand. You can add in or substitute the protein with chicken, beef, tofu, or ground meat. Noodles are a great way for clearing out your refrigerator of any vegetables or protein that you need to get rid of. Make sure that everything is cut into bite-sized pieces for fast and even cooking.

How to store. Noodles are best served fresh. Depending on the type of noodle, they might start to stick together and get a little stiff once they go cold. If you happen to have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, steam the noodles, heat on a skillet with a splash of water, or heat in the microwave.
